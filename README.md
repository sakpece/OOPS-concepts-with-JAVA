# OOPS-concepts-with-JAVA
-------------------------

Classes and Objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming which revolve around the real life entities.

Class - Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. It is a user defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
Object - The Entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. It is a bundle of data and its behaviour(often known as methods).
Method - A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task. It helps to define behaviour of class.
Message Passing - Passing information between Objects by using method and variables. 

Features of OOPS.
----------------
Abstraction -  Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user.
Encapsulation - Abstraction is a process where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from the user.
Polymorphism - It is a object oriented programming feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.
Inheritance - It is the mechanism by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.

Object-Oriented design:
----------------------
Coupling - It refers to how related or dependent two classes/modules are toward each other.((relation between modules)) 
Cohesion - It refers to the extent to which a class is defined to do a specific specialized task.(relation within module)
Association -It is a relationship between two objects. It defines the diversity between objects.
Aggregation - It represents the relationship where one object contains other objects as a part of its state. 
Composition - It is a specialized form of Aggregation.
